						<p>Well, by now you should've already guessed I'm JrColas. I'm currently a university student who
							wanted to add a 100th task on my schedule. This site was originally intended to only post
							any and all the music I make from FL Studio, but I had a change of mind. I've decided
							that I'll add other functions to the site as well. </p>
	
						<p>So now, I'll be trying the blogging world, see how that goes, while posting music and 
							other stuff that has yet to come. I've made this site from scratch with HTML and also made it 
							a Jekyll site. Wasn't that easy to make, but at least for now, it's working.
						</p>
						
						<p>I am still working on the site, fixing a few codes here and there, squashing bugs and stuff. Mobile 
							support isn't fully integrated yet; I'll be working on that shortly.</p>
							
						<p>Anyways, thanks for reading all that stuff above! Enjoy your stay!</p>
						<p>- JrColas</p>
