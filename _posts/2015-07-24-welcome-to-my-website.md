#Welcome to the JrColas Website!

<p>Thank you for visiting my website. If you came here yesterday, then you've noticed the big change today. 
I've made this website completely from scratch and I have never felt prouder (that's a word, right?). 
</p>

<p>On this website, I'm trying something new, and that's blogging. You are currently reading the first post! Congrats!</p>
<p>You will also find all the music I've created from FL Studio. There will be some new stuff coming on the site in
the near future, so keep on checking regularly. You can also follow me on social media from The Side Stuff.</p>

<p>As of today, I'm still working on the website, so not everything will look awesome yet. There are still codes I need to 
look over and change, add and all other stuff people do with codes. The mobile version of the site is not yet fully integrated,
as I am still working on it as well. Comments sections aren't in this post, however I believe I'll get that working 
by the time I make my second post.</p>

<p>For now, this is all I have for you to read. Thanks a million for checking out the site. Until next post, have a good one!</p>
