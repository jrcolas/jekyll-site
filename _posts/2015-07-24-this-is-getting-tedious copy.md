#This is getting tedious

Ok. Web developing requires lots of testing to get stuff working. I get it. I am trying to make
a blog website, and with all the coding I have to do, I need to test how the posts are going to 
work on the site. Now I'm trying to add buttons at the bottom of the blog page, but it seems to 
break the whole site whenever I add the one word...that's right.. ONE WORD of code I need to make it work. 
It might be a problem with my Jekyll local server, or it might just be something so obvious I don't even look 
at it. I don't know. <br>
What I do know is adding a bunch of blog posts to remove them all later is just too tedious for me. 
I think I need to rest a bit. My ranting has gone long enough. Later.
