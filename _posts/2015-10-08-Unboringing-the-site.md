## "Unboringing" the Site.

What does that mean, "unboringing" the site? Well, I've been looking at my last blog posts and as soon as I hit the link to view the post, somewhere lost deep inside of me, I sort of wish I didn't click. The page is so full with words that takes up the whole screen and it is just unpleasing to the eye. So I've decided to do something about it. 

I will be adding images to my next few blog posts from now on. At least that will be something to take your eyes off the words and make you smile a little.

Hopefully it'll look good by just easily attaching images on the posts, but I'm willing to change a few codes here and there to make it look perfect. I think I will also bring back the "Side Stuff" on the posts now. Probably for the better.
